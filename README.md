# roact-material
[Material design](https://material.io/) on Roblox, powered by [Roact](https://github.com/Roblox/Roact)!

## Notes

The biggest caveat with using RoactMaterial is that you **must** use [ZIndexBehavior](http://wiki.roblox.com/index.php?title=API:Class/LayerCollector/ZIndexBehavior) in **sibling mode**. Failure to do this will cause really weird issues.
